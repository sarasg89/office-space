## Credits

I followed [this tutorial](https://pencilprogrammer.com/self-referencing-foreign-key-in-mysql/) on how to create a self-referencing foreign key in MySQL.

I used this [ASCII generator](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&h=1&v=1&f=Banner&t=Employee%20%0AManager) to create the ASCII art for the app.
